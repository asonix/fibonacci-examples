# Elm Fibonacci

This is the Elm implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. Elm does not have
infinite generators the same way Haskell does. That said, we can pass in a
number and generate as many values as requested.

I wrote a blog post about this code [here](http://blog.asonix.dog/post/157726443394/who-wants-to-learn-elm-repost-two-previous-so-i).
