An example of providing access to infinite sequences in Elixir. Elixir's
Stream module makes creating infinite sequences very easy, and they are
interactable via functions from the Stream and Enumerator classes.

I wrote a blog post about this code [here](http://blog.asonix.dog/post/157910046439/who-wants-to-learn-elixir-here-i-demonstrate-how).
